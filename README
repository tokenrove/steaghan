This is steaghan version alpha zero. It is an alpha release, and is
yet ready for public consumption - think of this as a preview.  There
are no checks to determine whether the values one specifies nor the
files one provides are sane, and so improper use can lead to data
loss. (Most notably, in the current version, avoid using
wrapper/wav.so with large files, or with prpg/composite.so, as I have
experienced data loss when using the two together)

``Documentation'': (see also steaghan(1))
wrapper modules ---> allow steaghan to work with various file formats.
                     pgm -> portable graymap format
                     ppm -> portable pixmap format
                     wav -> microsoft wave format (riff)
                     bmp -> microsoft bitmap format
prpg modules ---> the core of steaghan, these modules decide how to spread
                  and mix the bits. [prpg stands for pseudorandom permutation
                                     generator, incidentally]
                  classic -> the ``classical'' shuffle algorithm - fast,
                             but very high in memory consumption 
                  lr -> the luby-rackoff construct, based on des. effective
                        but slow compared to classic. (uses very little 
                        memory, however)
                  composite -> lr construct for composite n, this module
                               is very effective for pixmaps and similar,
                               but can result in data loss for other formats.
file modules ---> 
                  seek ->
                  mmap ->
hash modules --->
                  md4 ->
                  md5 ->
                  ripemd160 ->
cipher modules --->
                  null ->
                  rot13 ->
                  rc5 ->
