.SH NAME
\fBsteaghan\fR \- a program for steganographic injection and extraction
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B steaghan
[\fIoptions\fR] [\-\-] <\fImode\fR> <\fIwrapper file\fR> [\fIsecret file\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fImode\fR is one of ``i'' or ``e'', standing for \fBi\fRnject or
\fBe\fRxtract, respectively.
.PP
\fIsecret file\fR may be either a file name, or ``-'' to read from
stdin. If it is not specified, stdin will be assumed.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR <\fIprpg module\fR>
Select a PRPG module [defaults to classic]. While the default is a
``safe bet'', careful selection of a PRPG module can vastly improve
performance and resource consumption.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR <\fIhash module\fR>
Select a hash module [defaults to ripemd160]. The default is recommended.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR <\fIfile module\fR>
Select a file access module [defaults to mmap]. The default is recommended.
.TP
\fB\-w\fR <\fIwrapper module\fR>
Select a wrapper module (appropriate to the type of the wrapper file). This
must be specified, as there is no sane default.
.TP
\fB\-k\fR <\fIkey file\fR>
Select an (optionally encrypted) key file, use \fB\-\fR for stdin, but
note that the key file and the secret file cannot both come from stdin
in one run.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR <\fIcipher module\fR>
Cipher with which to decrypt the key file. [defaults to null] If a cipher
other than null is specified, the user will be prompted to enter a passphrase
on stdin. The default is not safe, but allows pipelining and such.
.PP
Note that modules can be specified by their ``short'' name,
e.g. classic for (STEAGHAN_TOP_DIR)/prpg/classic.so, if they reside in
one of the known module directories. Alternately, the full path
(including the .so terminator) can be specified.
